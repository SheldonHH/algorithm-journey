XOR operation is addition without carrying.
XOR operation obeys the commutative and associative laws, meaning for the same group of numbers, no matter the order of XOR, the final result is always the same.
0^n = n, n^n = 0
If the overall XOR sum is x and the XOR sum of some part is y, then the XOR sum of the remaining part is x^y.
