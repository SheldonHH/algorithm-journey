Arithmetic Sequence Difference Problem Description:
Initially, all numbers from 1 to n are 0. Next, there are a total of m operations.
Each operation: Add an arithmetic sequence with the first term as s, the last term as e, and the common difference as d to the range from l to r.
In the end, every number from 1 to n must be correctly obtained.

Arithmetic Sequence Difference Process:
Each Operation Calls the 'set' Method: For each operation, a 'set' method is called to apply the arithmetic sequence to the given range.
After All Operations, Generate Prefix Sum Twice on Array arr by Calling 'build' Method: After all operations are completed, a 'build' method is called to generate the prefix sum twice on the array arr.
Final Numbers: The array arr will then contain the final numbers for every position from 1 to n.
This problem seems to describe a method for efficiently updating and querying an array by using the concept of an arithmetic sequence and difference array.
